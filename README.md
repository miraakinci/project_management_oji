#OJI Project Management System 

The project management system is a web-based application designed to streamline and enhance the process of managing complex projects. It provides a centralized platform for project managers and team members to track project progress, manage resources, and collaborate effectively. The system is built upon a robust and scalable architecture that integrates a traditional relational database with a modern vector database to offer both standard project management functionalities and advanced AI-powered features, such as semantic search. This hybrid approach allows the system to handle structured project data with the reliability of a relational database, while also leveraging the power of vector embeddings for intelligent data retrieval and analysis.
